## Howdy players! 
Thank you for using this site for all your GiS info. This site is where I will be putting my [[Session Recaps/]] as well as some more detailed info on most of the important stuff either you find in-game or that is already common knowledge. I will also put any homebrew mechanics and other out-of-game stuff here as well. 

I can't promise this will always be up to date, but I will try my best.
