## Overview

![[yara.jpg | 400]]

Yara is the bright, blue object at the center of the world that the islands seem to orbit. In [[Alari]], Yara is considered holy and is commonly worshipped by its people.

## Capabilities

- Compasses always point North towards Yara
- Yara doesn't provide any noticeable light as the sun does, although people can feel its presence as a warm, comforting hum
- Yara's light prevents the presence of the [[Void Sea]] 
- On a fluctuating cycle, Yara is almost completely obscured, allowing the Void Sea to rise and cause havoc on the islands
	- This is commonly known as an eclipse
	- Eclipses are normally forecasted by members of the [[The Alarin Church]]
- The mountain range on Alari creates a kind of shadow from Yara's light that allows the Void Sea to permeate the island in an area known as the [[Shadelands]]
