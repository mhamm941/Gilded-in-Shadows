### Before Session 1

#### The Beginning of Alari *(1 to 10 AE)*
* The Alarin people emerge in what is now known as Carda. They quickly learn of the [[Yara|eclipses]] and that the strange barriers made of pale, blue-grey stone that ward off the aberrations.
* As people explore outward, they find more of these barriers, and small towns begin to form.
* In each of these new towns, a strange, diamond shaped artifact is found and soon the [[The Alarin Church|Alarin Churches]] are formed.
* One of the first artifacts from before the Alarin people is discovered by Carda's Lake Postanak; an ancient looking tome found sealed in a stone and metal box. This tome is known as The Book of Echoes.

#### The Farewell Pilgrimage *(12 AE)*
- The older people of more long-lived lineages (mainly dwarves, elves, and halflings) began speaking about an incessant feeling that was pushing them to leave their new homes.  
- Some left quietly in the night, some formed groups that left with tearful goodbyes. All were never seen or heard from again.
- By the end of the year, a quarter of the Alarin population was gone.
- An exact age or timing for this phenomena has not been determined and still to this day, people get this urge later in their lives.

#### The Commonwealth *(20 AE)*
- The 8 towns of the Commonwealth are established.

#### Bellside Disaster 4/14/252
- A titanic beast erupted from a nearby forest and charged the town. The town was saved when the church’s artifact was activated, which also led to four individuals gaining strange golden marks.

#### Timberhorn Disaster 5/4/252
- Massive vines rampage the town, coming from the Ironheart forest. The church’s artifact was activated and successfully stopped the event. Three individuals have been reported to now have golden marks on their bodies.
