*Wondrous item, common*

When a creature regains hit points at the end of a short rest by spending one or more of its Hit Dice, that creature can regain extra hit points if it spends that short rest snuggling with one of these enchanted toys. The common owlbear variant of the _snugglebeast_ restores 1d6 hit points. Once this property of the _snugglebeast_ has been used by a creature, that creature can't benefit from the same _snugglebeast_ again in this way until it finishes a long rest.
