## Overview

![[brimorn.jpg | 300]]

Quillbranch is a roughly 4-foot tall gnome, with a thin build, and a wide face framed by his red, mane-like hair. He often wears spectacles and fine business/casual clothes. He is usually seen with a scroll or notebook as he walks about town giving warm greetings to his citizens. 

Most would describe him as an inquisitive and eccentric man who prioritizes his town and it's people. He has always been fascinated by the history of Alari in an academic sense and he works closely with other scholars and the church in their historical efforts.
