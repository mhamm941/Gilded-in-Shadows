## Overview

The gods of this world are few and largely unknown. There has been no direct contact with these beings with only a few mortals experiencing dreams believed to be divine. All known information and depictions of the pantheon have come from few historical texts that [[The Alarin Church]] hold and from individual accounts matching one another.

> [!info]+ Using the following info:

### Yara

**God of light, protection, and magic**

*(YAR-ah)*

The most commonly worshiped god as they are embodied by [[Yara |the blue object]] on the horizon. To pray, people make a circle with their right hand's fingers and cover that hand with their left, as [[Sister Lyela]] does.

### Yara Nem

**God of battle, fear, and emptiness**

*(YAR-ah NEM)*

Yara Nem represents the eclipses that happen seemingly at random. Though this aspect of Yara is rarely even spoken of, their presence is just as palpable.

### Selenir

**God of corruption, darkness, and the unknown**

*(SEL-e-near)*

Selenir is seen as the unholy power that is the [[Void Sea]], constantly threatening to overrun the mainland. Despite the wide belief that they are a force of evil, some still pray to them, whether in true faith or as a way of appeasement for mercy during the eclipses.

### Novalyon

**God of change, peace, and the infinite**

*(NOV-al-EE-on)*

The counterpart to Selenir, Novalyon's domain is the outer sky of the sun, the stars, and clouds of opalescent dust. While it is uncertain if the two gods are in fact aspects of one being or if they are twins or enemies, many agree that one cannot exist without the other.
