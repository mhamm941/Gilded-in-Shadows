The Alarin Church stands as an important part of the Commonwealth. Each established town has a church that represents a place of worship for any of the gods, though Yara is the primary god people pray to.

The churches also work closely with historians and archaeologists in the efforts to uncover Alari's mysterious past.

## Additional Details

- Each church has an artifact that was present before the towns were established. These artifacts were prophesized to be necessary in saving each town in the event of some disaster. 
	- The first of these disasters happened at Bellside.
	- Some churches place these artifacts in the main chamber for all to see and worship. Other churches put them in their bell towers or in storage for safe keeping.
	- The artifacts are diamond shaped objects with golden edges and a faint blue glow within the transparent interior.
