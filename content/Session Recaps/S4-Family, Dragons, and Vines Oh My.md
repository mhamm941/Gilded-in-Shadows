## Session Overview

After an encounter on their final night of travel with the kobold mage the party fought [[S1-The Big Fucking Hole|5 days ago]], the party arrives in [[Timberhorn]]. With Elion leading the way, they stop at Thultaea's Hand, Elion's family home and his mom's apothecary. [[Lireal Thultaea-Gourdfell|Lireal]] has been busy crafting potions and medicines for the almost 100 injured from the disaster 7 days prior, and [[Markus Gourdfell|Markus]] has been healing from his own injuries. [[Veritar Crucix]], a sapphire dragonborn who was one of the golden-marked in Timberhorn, arrives as he helps Lireal with medical deliveries. The group recounts the events that has happened within the last month before deciding to investigate where the monstrous vines originated from. The party of 5 travels into the Ironheart forest and find that the multiple paths of destruction lead to the same point not dissimilar to the hole near Bellside. 

## Key Learnings

- The new golden-marked individuals from Timberhorn are Veritar, [[Wilmo Ostran]], and [[Thula Malukaga]], the latter two of which were amongst the injured.
