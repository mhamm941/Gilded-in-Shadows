## Session Overview

After descending into the ruins below the Ironheart forest, the party finds a chamber with rings of dirt and stone. They quickly discover more of the healing red goo within the debris and gather enough to fill two vials. Exploring further, the party comes to a grand room with strange plants and a maiden with golden growths on her skeletal body fading from existence. Despite their cautious approach, she initiates a trial by summoning a stone warrior entangled in vines. Nesta quickly dispatched the stone halo empowering the rampaging statue, setting up the rest of the party to batter their foe, dropping it prone. A final shot from Elion left the warrior in a pile of stone but before the party could celebrate, the maiden spoke her parting words and the remains of the warrior were replaced by an orb of ethereal smoke. Carien snatched the orb and briefly entered a starry void. 

The party decided to take a short rest after the ordeal. Elion and Nesta gathered strange flowers while Carien and Veritar had a heated conversation that Augustus had to break up. Once the feeling of dread from the coming eclipse crept into their minds, however, the party left in a mad dash for the surface leaving behind any conflict they had. Racing back to Timberhorn, they encountered nightmarish creatures heading in the same direction. The party made it to town just before the gate closed, and now they prepare for whatever horrors they may face.

## Key Learnings

- The stone debris in the initial underground chamber hold intricate carvings and formed some kind of structure.
- The grand chamber with the strange plants and the skeletal woman appeared to be consecrated, and the woman herself possessed a holy aura, although she wasn't an actual celestial creature.
- Her final words were - 
> [!quote]-  
> Listen well, ye marked by the forgotten seal, for your world whispers truths unseen and the stars sing of ancient echoes. In times beyond memory, in the age before reckoning, the Dreaming Demiurge, whose essence still clings to this fractured realm, wove a desperate enchantment. His power, born of dreams and despair, suspended the kingdom in the air, crafting floating isles adrift around a celestial mind.
> 
> Within these ruins, echoes of the Demiurgeâ€™s will still linger, marking you as harbingers of a destiny unseen. The watcher binds your fate to the unraveling of this darkened world's forgotten past. To free the world that is and the world that once was, you must walk in shadows, unravel truths bound in silence, and wield the strength of those who once fought for the dream that gave life to your world.
> 
> Go forth, and let the memory of the Dreaming Demiurge guide your steps. For it is written in the celestial scripts: when the gilded rise, the dream may yet find its end. Seek out the forgotten relics, kindle the ancient flames, and may your courage pierce the shrouded veil, lest the cataclysm consume all.

## Who Did They Meet?

**The maiden.** Her body of porcelain skin and cancerous, gold bones slowly fade from existence as she speaks her final words with a soft voice that demands attention.
