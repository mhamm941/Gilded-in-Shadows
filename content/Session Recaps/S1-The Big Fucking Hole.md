## Session Overview

After being tasked with scouting the land where the Beast erupted from 2 weeks prior, the party set off with a group of town guards now only a half mile behind. They followed the Beast's massive tracks to the destroyed tree line, only to be stopped by an ambush of Kobolds. One of their attackers seemed to be proficient in magic, successfully putting Carien and his horse to sleep while casting firebolts at Nesta in chase. Another kobold painted with strange markings and easily cut down by Augustus's axe began to bubble and writhe. At the end of the fight, the kobold mage ran away with its life and the corpse of the painted kobold exploded in Augustus's face. The following guards soon caught up to the party at the sign of the released flare and it was decided they would join them the rest of the way. 

At the destroyed tree line, Elion discovered the makeshift camp the kobolds were supposedly using. With Carien's help, they discovered interesting tracks from an unknown creature that led towards the site of the Beast's emergence. Investigating the giant hole, they found scraps of strange debris and a wider cavern below. The party decided that this was far enough and they returned to Bellside to drink with the guards and to explain the details to Mayor Quillbranch.

## Key Learnings

- There is another creature that recently walked through the destroyed forest
- The strange debris resembles web structures made by giant spiders
- Kobolds casting magic has never been heard of before and the exploding corpse is also strange
- The Beast burrowed out from underground

## Who Did They Meet?

**[[Mayor Brimorn Quillbranch]].** Bellside's inquisitive and dutiful mayor.

**[[Wyliam Hanon]].** Captain of Bellside's town guard.

**[[Sister Lyela]].** A member of the church who is always seen with at least one animal following her.

## Items Of Importance

- Strange Debris - Seemingly composed of overlapping layers of some thin material. It is a pale gray color with a texture like pumice or sandstone. Brimorn was able to peel a layer of the retrieved piece and concluded that it somewhat resembles structures made by giant spiders.
