### Alarin Date: 5/9/252 - 5/11/252
## Session Overview

After an accident involving a crushed vial of red goo and then crushing another vial on purpose, Elion and [[Mayor Brimorn Quillbranch]] discover that the goo may have the potential to be distilled into potions of healing. Quillbranch tells Elion about a friend in [[Carda]] called [[Salen Toggletop]], a gnome scientist, who would have the knowledge of whether this is possible and then how to do it. While Elion is rounding up the party, a mail caravan from the west arrives in [[Bellside]] to relay the news that a disaster has occurred in [[Timberhorn]], Elion's hometown. This event involved rampaging vines, rather than a giant beast, however the vines were able to cross the protective barrier of the town. The party decides to make the 3 day journey to Timberhorn instead of going to Carda. 

On the first day, while discussing their pasts, the trees begin to shake without wind and a mob of humanoid creatures jump over the road, across the tree lines. They appear to teleport behind trees in erratic patterns as they are chased by a large, orange feline with black stripes that drape off the muscular body, with three golden red eyes framed by a large black stripe. One of the humanoids falls to the ground and quickly pounces back into the trees, but not before leaving behind a strange, charred stick that fails to break in Carien's hands. Augustus tells the party of a similar event that happened to him during his days as a caravan guard. The second day begins after the party leaves the quiet town of [[Gladeboro]], and the party passes a family traveling from Timberhorn who warn of sightings a "metal man" seen around the town.

## Key Learnings

## Who Did They Meet?
