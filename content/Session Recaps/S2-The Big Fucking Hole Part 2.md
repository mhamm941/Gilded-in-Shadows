## Session Overview

The party returns to the destroyed forest with [[Mayor Brimorn Quillbranch]] and a few guards. In the underground cavern, they find a massive structure built of the same material as the strange debris they found the previous day centered around man made structures. They explore the crumbling pillars and an elevated stage with arcane markings carved into it and find a broken horn from the Beast as well as a strange red goo lining the walls. Continuing their exploration, the party comes across a hallway leading to a fight with spiders on the stairs and kobolds in the above room. After the battle, they discover that the wall that would be facing the main cavern is made mostly of floor to ceiling glass covering the rock face. On their way out, Nesta finds a suspiciously clean stuffed owlbear toy and soon learns its a magical item.
## Key Learnings

- The Beast was most likely contained by the strange cocoon after having been summoned, bound, or created by the arcane structures.
- Despite the artificial structures in this cavern, much of their design doesn't make sense.

## Items Of Importance

- [[Snugglebeast]] - An stuffed owlbear toy for comfort while taking a rest.
